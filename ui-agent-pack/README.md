# AI Agent UI/UX Pack (Web + Mobile + Hebrew/RTL)

This pack is a **drop-in set of markdown docs** you can hand to AI agents (or humans) to keep UI/UX output consistent, modern, and shippable.

## Files
- `rules.md` — global operating rules for agents (tone, output format, quality gates)
- `ui-ux-guidelines.md` — practical UI/UX rules (layout, components, accessibility, motion, performance)
- `mobile-first.md` — mobile-first decision rules + responsive patterns
- `hebrew-rtl.md` — Hebrew-first product rules (RTL, typography, microcopy, locale pitfalls)
- `prompt-playbook.md` — how to break down complex tasks into executable plans + deliverables
- `mcp-tooling.md` — how to use MCPs like Context7 + Supabase MCP to read docs & project structure
- `checklists.md` — pre-ship checklists (design, accessibility, performance, i18n)
